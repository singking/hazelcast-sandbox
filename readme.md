Common problems with Hazelcast
https://youtu.be/5tpAmWuE3J4?t=11m45s
Listeners: use specific listener and hand off control to another thread ASAP. Caution with the value object exposed in the event listener
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/IMap.html#addEntryListener-com.hazelcast.core.EntryListener-boolean-
Can we not add the listener in the server rather than a client??

4.3. Create Hazelcast Java Client
Hazelcast client allows us to do all Hazelcast operations without being a member of the cluster. It connects to one of the cluster members and delegates all cluster-wide operations to it.

Letâ€™s create a native client:

ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
GroupConfig groupConfig = config.getGroupConfig();
groupConfig.setName("dev");
groupConfig.setPassword("dev-pass");
HazelcastInstance hzClient
  = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(config);
The default username and password to access the cluster are dev and dev-pass. For more details on Hazelcast client, you can check out the following link.
